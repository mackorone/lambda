2.) Output the steps of reduction
    (* Whether or not to output the reduction steps *)
    (*val redStepPrompt = "    * ";*)
    (*val showRedSteps = false;*)

3.) Expanded lambda to allow for names ( I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER )
    OR (CAN'T DO BOTH)
3.) Get the sugared lambda function form to work

3.) Figure out how to stop infinite recursion

4.) Eta reduction

5.) Comments in the loadable files
val sc_comment   = #"#"; (* TODO *)

6.) Ensure that the REQ have associated REQ_VIOLATIONs

Write optimized version in C

Make sure all calls are tail recursive
